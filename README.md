# Steganography Website

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to hide and retrieve secret messages within images using steganography techniques. The application consists of both front-end and back-end components, working together to provide a seamless user experience.

### Front-End

The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with Bootstrap for responsive design. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload images, enter secret messages, and download the steganographed images. Key features include:

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images in various formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- **Message Input**: Users can input the secret message they want to hide within the image. The input field supports text of varying lengths.
- **Image Preview**: Users can preview the image before and after steganography to ensure the message is correctly embedded.
- **Download Option**: Users can download the image with the hidden message in the same format as the uploaded image.

### Back-End

The back-end is developed using a server-side language such as Python or Node.js, with frameworks like Flask or Express. It handles the core steganography logic and interacts with the front-end through RESTful API endpoints. Key features include:

- **Steganography Algorithm**: Implements algorithms such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) to hide and retrieve messages within images.
- **Image Processing**: Handles image encoding and decoding, ensuring the integrity of the image is maintained.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for the front-end to send and receive data, including image files and text messages.
- **Security**: Ensures that the hidden messages are securely embedded and retrieved, possibly using encryption techniques for added security.

### Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Material UI
- **Back-End**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: Optional, for storing user data and images, using databases like SQLite, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL


### Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Adding login and registration features to allow users to manage their steganographed images and messages.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implementing more sophisticated steganography techniques, such as frequency domain methods.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring the application works well on mobile devices, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
- **User Interface Improvements**: Enhancing the UI/UX for better usability and aesthetics.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving the performance of image processing and steganography algorithms for faster results.

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective way to securely communicate hidden messages through images, leveraging modern web technologies and steganography techniques.
